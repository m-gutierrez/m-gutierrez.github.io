    image-caption: Twins oven test  
    image-description: This was the first full install of the Twins experiment optical cavity with a working HOA2 trap. The optical cavity is formed by two mirrors on the small glass rectangles over-hanging the trap. Note - optical cavity not in final install. A blue-streak can be seen during this oven test from fluorescing neutral strontium atoms.

    image-description: Beam routing for experiment lasers into a single PCF. All experiment wavelengths are routed through a endlessly single-mode polarization maintaining fiber with a 5 $\mu$m core. Each beam achieves a fiber-coupling efficiency of $>$50% through the use of a parabolic in-coupling mirror and telescoping lenses in each beam path.

    image-description: dDepiction of the interferometry protocol steps 1-5. With steps 1 and 5 consisting of ramsey sequences mapping populations to/from phases on a super-position of spin-states (bottom frame). The top frame demonstrates the acquired phase produced by coherent displacements $\pm\gamma$ and $\alpha_F$ in steps 2-4 which are mapped to the spin-states (bottom frame) through the entangling operations.

    image-description: (a) experiment view with laser-beam geometry and ion positions shown. (b) Depiction of a ramsey-experiment where optical phase changes are implemented by nano-scale movement of each ion using control electrodes. (c) electronic state 4D5/2 population after the described ramsey sequence vs the distance the ion is moved.

    image-caption: Position controlled quantum logic gates
    image-description: a) Image of the surface trap indicating geometries of magnetic field, as well as Doppler, detection, and qubit beams. The two trapping zones of interest, Z1 and Z2, are labeled with ion fluorescence shown. b) Timing and space diagram for position controlled gate, ions are moved individually within global 674 nm beam to implement a unique zone-dependent qubit rotation. c/d) Results implementing an arbitrary rotation in each zone while performing one of three constant operations (identity, $\pi/4$ and $\pi/2$) in the other. Scanned contrast is 99.1% and residuals are within statistical uncertainty. Each target rotation is repeated 400 times and error bars represent quantum projection noise for this sampling.
