    image-description: This was the first full install of the Twins experiment optical cavity with a working HOA2 trap. The optical cavity is formed by two mirrors on the small glass rectangles over-hanging the trap. A blue-streak can be seen during this oven test from fluorescing neutral strontium atoms.
