    image-description: This is a tree overlooking Manitou lake in Teller county, Colorado. A family favorite spot that we often go to for bbq or just to get out of the house. I love the lighting and colors in the tree. The dark foreground and the tree leading up to the single cloud and moon in the sky. I don't like the random bits of neighboring tree peaking into the frame.
