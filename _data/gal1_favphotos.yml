    image-caption: Manitou lake - Teller county, Colorado 
    image-description: This is a tree overlooking Manitou lake in Teller county, Colorado. A family favorite spot that we often go to for bbq or just to get out of the house. I love the lighting and colors in the tree. The dark foreground and the tree leading up to the single cloud and moon in the sky. I don't like the random bits of neighboring tree peaking into the frame.

    image-caption: micro Cavity experiment - Cambridge, Massachusetts
    image-description: This was the first experiment I built at MIT. Taken shortly after the first bake to ultra-high vacuum. Unfortunately, We didn't trap during this attempt. We observed voltage breakdown on the trapping device preventing us from successfully confining any ions. I like the personification of the chamber here, kind of ninja-like headband and the viewports make for a nice pair of eyes.

    image-caption: Boat - Copenhagen, Denmark
    image-description: Random boat we walked past when visiting Copenhagen. I believe this was near the royal palaces, not that it really matters. This day was surprisingly cold which made taking pictures a pretty low priority, unfortunately. I like the lens flare and the center frame in focus painter.

    image-description: I took this picture sometime shortly after I got my camera. My sister gifted me this chess board for Christmas. I really like the depth of field and the colors here. The more I look at this the more I appreciate the detail of the pieces (or piece... Mario).

    image-description: The building on the left is the Rundetaarn and on the right is the best roasted nuts I've ever had. probably because I was freezing and hungry and they were warm and delicious.

    image-caption: Nordkette Cable Car - Innsbruck, Austria
    image-description: This was taken in late november while I was visiting a lab at the university. A friend and I decided to take the cable car to the top of the mountain. We hoped we'd get a view of the valley but the weather turned as we were on our way up and didn't get to see much. On the way back down it really started snowing Hence the barely visible visitor center.

    image-caption: Bookshelf - Boston, Massachusetts
    image-description: I took this in our first apartment after moving across the country to boston. Somehow we managed to grab an amazing apartment on Boylston st. across from the Lenox hotel and right down the street from the prudential center. All of which is apparent from this bookshelf (sarcasm). Thanks to my cousin for the radiometer and my mom for the chest.

    image-description: I'm not sure when I took this picture, possibly shortly before graduation. It reminds me that I didn't explore enough of the campus while I was there.

    image-caption: Himmelbjerget - Søhøjlandet, Denmark
    image-description: I'm not sure why I like this so much but I do. This was taken at Himmelbjerget 'Sky mountain' in Denmark, a whopping 482ft high hill with a small-medium sized tower on top of it. Probably mid-way through a physics? sponsored hike through the surrounding area. At the time I was a visiting student at Aarhus university working in an ion lab there.
