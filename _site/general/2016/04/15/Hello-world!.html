<p>Is this working? Seems like it.</p>

<p>This is my final year as a graduate student (at least I think so) and most of my graduate career has been spent building infrastructure that will hopefully allow us to perform state-of-the-art quantum information processing (QIP) with trapped ions. In particular, we’ve been working toward creating an interface between trapped ion quantum computing (TIQC (pronounced Tick-see)) and photonic quantum communication and networking.</p>

<p>We keep an internal lab blog which generally tracks our day-to-day triumphs and woes but as my time hear nears its end. I’d like to share these posts with a boarder audience, mostly family and friends, but generally those who I don’t spend everyday with. My hope is that this will make it clear where context is missing, and make it easier to explain to family and friends exactly what I’ve been doing here. On a more selfish note, our internal blog is also where 90% of my note-taking / ‘thinking out load’ takes place and I realized I should probably prepare a replacement for this platform.</p>

<p>So to start out with, current we’re preparing to assembly what will be my thesis experiment. This consists of two key components, the first is our ion trap and the second is a small optical cavity.</p>
