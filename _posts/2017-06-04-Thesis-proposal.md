# Introduction


Trapped ion systems represent some of the most pristine quantum systems currently demonstrated. For a wide variety of elements groups have demonstrated complete control of both internal electronic states and external motional degrees of freedom, regularly producing initial states of both with >99% purity. This wide range of control has led and in turn been led by applications of quantum information processing, where precise and accurate manipulation of the quantum state is essential to perform practical algorithms. While proof of principle experiments have been demonstrated (shor, bernstein vazirani, grovers) scaling to systems with computing power beyond that of classical systems has remained out of reach and is an active area of research. The struggles in developing such a system are two-fold: firstly, universal gate fidelities have yet to reach fault tolerant thresholds for small code sizes (10's of physical qubits), and secondly, increasing the number of physical qubits suffer from a number of systematic effects further decreasing the achieved gate fidelities.
