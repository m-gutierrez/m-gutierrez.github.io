# Introduction


Trapped ion systems represent some of the most pristine quantum systems currently demonstrated. For a wide variety of elements groups have demonstrated complete control of both internal electronic states and external motional degrees of freedom, regularly producing initial states of both with >99% purity. This wide range of control has led and in turn been led by applications of quantum information processing, where precise and accurate manipulation of the quantum state is essential to perform practical algorithms. While proof of principle experiments have been demonstrated [1,2,3] scaling to systems with computing power beyond that of classical systems has remained out of reach and is an active area of research. The struggles in developing such a system are two-fold: firstly, universal gate fidelities have yet to reach fault tolerant thresholds for small code sizes (10's of physical qubits), and secondly, increasing the number of physical qubits suffer from a number of systematic effects further decreasing the achieved gate fidelities. Beyond applications to quantum computing the performance achieved in these systems have led to steady improvements in quantum sensing applications, such as atomic clocks[4], magnetometry [5], electrometry [6], and inertial sensors [7].

This thesis work progresses both quantum information processing and quantum sensing through the development of state-of-the-art classical control systems and novel techniques for improved quantum control. In particular we focus on developing techniques which reduce laser control and power overhead required for scaling ion trap systems while maintaining maximum parallelism of applied quantum logic gates, as well as protocols for phase-sensitive detection of perturbing forces.
