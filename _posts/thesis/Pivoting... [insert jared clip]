Pivoting... [insert jared clip]


I've been trying to put together a system with 2 goals. One, which I am strongly interested in, What can quantum information do for physics. That is how can a system in which we understand and control nearly everything in it help us understand something new? The second, which I am vaguely interested in, How can one engineer a strongly coupled single-photon single-ion system within a semi-scalable trap architecture?

The problem with the second question is that even if one had such a system, it takes answering the first question to really do something of note with it. This isn't something that recently dawned on me, its something that I've voiced throughout this program, and attempted to address by building a system who's goal was to purely focus on ion trap quantum computing, and ignore the cavity bit. At the time there were no functioning ion traps within the group so it also made sense from a fundamental building block perspective. 

This however split our 2 person team in two... either of these problems are difficult and requiring two untrained persons to both conceptualize and build the setup is just a made move, let alone just one. 

Anyway, so we're not at a point where much of the technology and techniques needed to do an interesting cavity experiment simply haven't been developed or tested. So before hammering away at a cavity-problem with faulty parts, I'm going to focus on the first question. 

What can quantum information do for physics? 

There's actually a lot I'm implying with that question too, I don't really mean the theory of quantum information which has obviously progressed far faster than experiments can keep up. And I don't mean theoretically what can experiments do for physics, though this is certainly a question that is always produces interesting results. I mean what can current systems built with the intent or ability to perform rudimentary quantum information processing do for physics?
