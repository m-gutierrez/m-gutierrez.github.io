>"The difference between an amateur and professional scientist is documentation." - Isaac Chuang

This is easily the most impact-full sentence Ike has ever said to me. Its something that I've really taken to heart during my graduate career. so colors, Why are there so many... 

I'd like to put together a few templates for matplotlib to easily produce reasonably pretty plots for different formats, this blog, lab blog, general ipython notebooks, publications etc. The largest difference between the different formats is color scheme and this is something that a lot of people have had a lot to say on. 

This isn't something I'm surprised by, that happened about 2-3 years ago when I attended a 'Improving presentation skills in physics' talk at Aarhus university. 

Where there was quiet a lot of controversy amongst the crowd and presenter on most formatting options, especially those that tend to lean/clean plots. But I think there was general agreement that default color schemes and those most commonly used in publications are pretty bad. This seemed to be due to two conflicting goals when using a particular color palette, 1. Being able to visual identify absolute differences between regions of a plot and 2. being able to easily distinguish between adjacent colors. 1. seems to be ignored the most, with people relying on an adjacent legend to help people decipher the result. which usually leads people to focus on 2 by selecting a range of very distinct colors and cycling through them at random.

Even if your not going to make your own color palette, this will make you more aware of how your data will look to an outside audience. This is probably one of the biggest problems in data visualization, having spent months are several years collecting data and trying to understand that data by the time you write a publication you have a lot of bias and implicit assumptions in what your data is actually showing. 




<h2> Matplotlib style files </h2>


The best way to generate a plot configuration you'd like to reuse is through matplotlib's style files (".mplstyle") There are a few default styles right off the bat, including 'ggplot'. if you search for that file extension you can find where your default styles are located and see what they contain. 

for example, here is the file for the
